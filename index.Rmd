This website describes the data input and possible outputs of the application programming interface (**API**) for [MPAtlas.org](http://www.mpatlas.org) related to protections and enforcement of marine protected areas (MPAs) globally. Data gets ingested from a variety of sources into the database upon which the API sits. The API can then be used to feed data into scripts, reports and applications.
